# Pokémon Dream Team
This project uses data from the PokéAPI and renders the fetched pokémon data into a 6 character team, each character being contained in an individual card component. I loved playing Pokémon as a kid and I've created routes with React Router to take the user to my ideal 6 character team per generation. 

I've also included a 'Random Party Maker' tab which generates a random party of 6 for the user from whatever generation that has been chosen. In other words, I've filtered the ranges of possible drawn values according to the pokédex numbers associated with each generation of pokémon. I've also set up the generator to not include any duplicates of pokémon in the party of 6 - you will get a unique set of 6 pokémon each time you generate a team. 

*Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, React, React Router, External APIs*
